# README

Welcome to the Restaurant Guide application! All you need to do to run the application is type the following commands:
 - `bundle install` 
 - `rake db:migrate`
 - `rails s` 

If you'd like to start with some seed data, you can run `rake db:seed` to populate data from the `db/seeds.rb` file.

This application has 3 models - Users, Restaurants, and Experiences. Experiences are the reviews users can write about restaurants.
